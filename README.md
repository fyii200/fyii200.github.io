# [Welcome](https://fyii200.github.io)
I am a PhD candidate based in the [Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences), with affliations to [SCONe](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-sciences/ophthalmology/scone/about-scone) and [VAMPIRE](https://vampire.computing.dundee.ac.uk). The broad focus of my PhD is to apply artificial intelligence approaches (like everyone else huh?) to predicting *short-sightedness **(myopia)***. The primary aim of this site is to support the [Open Science Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and document my work where possible, i.e. if not at risk of confidential data breaches.

**PS, this is just the repository for the site and where I give a high-level overview of my research; actual site can be accessed [here](https://fyii200.github.io).**

## Why myopia? Because it is far more than just an optical inconvinience.
Myopia is the most common form of refractive error. In 2020, over 30% of the global population is believed to be myopic, and this figure is predicted to reach nearly 50% by 2050<sup>1</sup>. But what's the big deal? Some may ask. Well, in addition to the significant economic burden, which is in and of itself a significant topic (I refer keen readers to this [chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-8491-2_3)<sup>2</sup> from *Updates on Myopia*), myopia increases the risk of a host of potentially sight-threatening conditions like retinal detachment, myopic maculopathy, glaucoma-like optic neuropathy, etc. While the term 'physiological myopia' was used as an allusion to safe levels of myopia, evidence now rejects that idea and instead suggests that each diopter matters<sup>3</sup>. 

## Aetiology of Myopia: Nature or Nurture?
Following the seminal work of Wiesel and Raviola in 1977, numerous animal studies provide strong evidence that refractive error of a developing eye can be manipulated under laboratory conditions. For instance, one can quite literally induce some desired amount of refractive error by forcing the eye concerned to look through a lens of equivalent power for a protracted period of time. We can play God so to speak â€” the development of myopia is not completely deterministic after all. It is now widely accepted that the development of myopia arises from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Human epidemiological studies point towards reduced outdoor time (probably due to less light exposure but still an area of active research) and intensive education as strong environmental risk factors.
