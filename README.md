# [Welcome](https://fyii200.github.io)
I am a PhD candidate based in the [Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences), with affliations to [SCONe](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-sciences/ophthalmology/scone/about-scone) and [VAMPIRE](https://vampire.computing.dundee.ac.uk). The big picture goal of my PhD 
is to apply artificial intelligence approaches to predicting *short-sightedness **(myopia)***. The primary aim of this site is to support the [Open Science Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and document my work where possible, i.e. if not at risk of confidential data breaches.

**PS, this is just the repository for the site where code, figures, etc. are stored. I also give a high-level overview of the background of my research below. 
Actual site can be accessed [here](https://fyii200.github.io).**

## Why myopia? 
### Because it is far more than just an optical inconvinience.
Myopia is the most common form of refractive error. In 2020, over 30% of the global population is believed to be myopic, and this figure is set to reach nearly 50% by 2050<sup>1</sup>. But what's the big deal? Some may ask. Well, in addition to the significant economic burden, which is in and of itself a big topic (I refer keen readers to this [chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-8491-2_3)<sup>2</sup> from *Updates on Myopia*), myopia increases the risk of a host of potentially sight-threatening eye diseases, e.g. retinal detachment, myopic maculopathy, glaucoma-like optic neuropathy, etc. Evidence now rejects such term as 'physiological myopia' because it carries the erroneous implication that some level of myopia is safe <sup>3</sup>. 

## Aetiology of myopia 
### Nature or nurture?
Following the seminal work of Wiesel and Raviola<sup>4</sup> in 1977, numerous animal studies provide strong evidence that refractive error of a developing eye can be manipulated under laboratory conditions (for an excellent review, see IMI report on experimental models of myopia<sup>5</sup>). For instance, one can quite literally induce some desired amount of refractive error by forcing the eye concerned to look through a lens of equivalent power for a protracted period of time. We can play God so to speak â€” the development of myopia is not purely deterministic after all. It is now widely accepted that the development of myopia arises from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors<sup>6</sup>. Epidemiologic studies point towards reduced outdoor time (light intensity probably plays an important role but this is still an area of active research) and intensive education as strong environmental risk factors<sup>7</sup>.

## 'Myo'cene: dawn of the epoch of myopia interventions.
### The driving force.
The plethora of animal models and, to a lesser extent human models, in myopia research seems to get us closer to deciphering the origin of myopia (though we are still far from there in absolute terms). For instance, refractive error can still be modulated under laboratory conditions even when the connection between the eye and brain is cut off, or when the fovea (central part of the retina which we rely heavily on for high-resolution vision) is ablated. Taken together, we now know that the driving force of myopia is local to the eye and that peripheral retina also plays an active role. 

At present, it is believed that some kind of visual stimuli, e.g. defocus/ blur, set off a cascade of biochemical changes in the retina, choroid and sclera. The whole cascade of events eventually leads to scleral (white coat of the eye) remodelling, making it weaker and more amenable to stretching. It is for this reason that an overwhelming majority of people with myopia are myopic because of longer eyes (axial myopia). Elongation of the eye, as it turns out, has deleterious effect on the posterior structures of the eye. This explains why (axial) myopia is associated myriad posterior eye diseases.  

### Beyond standard optical correction.
Thanks to these new insights, interventions that aim to slow down childhood progression of myopia are becoming available in recent years. These are usually optical interventions that impose myopic defocus on peripheral retina, i.e. force the light to focus before the retina in the periphery so the central high-resolution vision is not affected. Pharmaceutical interventions, most popular being atropine (routinely used in parts of the world), arrived on the scene rather serendipituously. They were initially used for myopia control based on the theory that the accommodative system plays a role in myopia development and progression, but the balance of evidence now tilts against this theory. 

Although the exact mechanisms remain nebulous, atropine and a number of optical interventions have been shown to be effective in slowing down myopia progression in many clinical trials. Behavioural interventions, most notably increased outdoor time, also appear to be promising in mitigating myopia development. An increasing number of eye care practitioners are offering these interventions. **The advent of 'Myo'cene opens up exciting opportunities to tackle the myopia epidemic. But at the same time, new challenges arise..**
