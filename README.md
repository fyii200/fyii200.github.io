## [Welcome](https://fyii200.github.io)
I am a PhD candidate based in Edinburgh's [Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences). The broad focus of my PhD is to apply artificial intelligence
approaches (like everyone else huh?) to predicting *short-sightedness **(myopia)***. I work as part of the [SCONe](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-sciences/ophthalmology/scone/about-scone) 
and [VAMPIRE](https://vampire.computing.dundee.ac.uk) teams. The primary aims of this site are to support the [Open Science Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science)
and document my work where possible, i.e. if not at risk of confidential data breaches.

**PS, this is just the repository for the site and where I give a high-level overview of my research; actual site can be accessed [here](https://fyii200.github.io).**

More coming soon..
