Refractive error (ametropia thereafter) arises from a mismatch between axial length (AL) and the effective power of the refractive components of the eye, i.e. cornea, crystalline lens. Such mismatch is often (predominantly) **axial** in nature. AL is typically high (>24mm as a fairly useful rule of thumb) in myopes. Importantly, axial elongation is mainly attributable to changes in vitreous chamber depth. This explains why myopia is associated with clinical features in the posterior segment of the eye, e.g. peripapillary atrophy (PPA), tesselation.

In trying to elucidate what a deep learning (DL) model such as [Varadarajan's](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2683803) looks at when predicting refractive error (regression task) from fundus images, I'm drawn to think that a large part of the model is really just predicting the axial component of ametropia. This is based on the understanding that: 
1. Variation in corneal and lenticular features is hardly reflected in a fundus image (other than fundus magnification? But see below).
2. Retinal features that could possibly hold information about ametropia are mostly axial in nature.

Regarding (2), these retinal features **does not necessarily have to be biologically meaningful**, i.e. retinal thinning, PPA, etc., but they can also be related to the complex interactions between the camera system and the optics peculiar to the eye. One prominent example of the latter is the **variation in fundus magnification** across different levels of ametropia, which I will focus on in another post. For now, it is suffice to say that: 
> the main source of variation in fundus magnification is variation in AL rather than cornea/ lens curvature.

Taken together, we can hypothesise that:
> DL should at least be as good at predicting AL from fundus images as it is at predictng ametropia.

By extension, this also implies that:
> DL can predict axial ametropia better than refractive ametropia. 
 
**To test the last hypothesis, I first explore how classification of refractive ametropia and axial ametropia can be done in another post.** If the null hypothesis is to be rejected, then a lack of information pertaining to corneal/ lens curvature in retinal images could have some negative impact on a model's regression performance. One would, therefore, naturally hope that the **axial ametropia that we so often speak of is purely axial**, i.e. like a Gullstrand's schematic eye with axial ametropia where the effective power of the eye is fixed at +58.60D, and the only variable is AL.   

But real-world data suggest otherwise. We get a fuller picture of an eye's refractive state with the addition of anterior corneal radius (CR). When modelled with a simple linear regression, AL alone does not explain the observed variance in spherical equivalent refraction (SER) to a very high degree. Published studies have reported <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?R^2" title="R^2" /> values of [0.580](https://journals.lww.com/optvissci/Abstract/1994/09000/Role_of_the_Axial_Length_Corneal_Radius_Ratio_in.5.aspx) and [0.432](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111766&type=printable). When **anterior CR** is considered alongside AL, i.e. AL/CR, the observed variance in SER increases **considerably** to **0.837** and **0.658**, respectively.

This is corroborated by an unpublished dataset that I am playing with (412 instances; unknown age but likely to be university students). <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?R^2" title="R^2" /> increases from **0.697** with AL to **0.817** with AL/CR (see Figure 1). Older age could [partly explain](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2183169) why our <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?R^2" title="R^2" />  is higher, since compensatory lens/ corneal changes are more likely to be seen in younger children (in the two studies above, age â‰¤ 12y/o) than adults. 

#### Figure 1

As seen in Figure 2, the distribution of residuals is negatively skewed when we only consider AL (left), indicating that some variation in SER is left unaccounted for by other factor(s). Indeed, the distribution is more gaussian-like with the addition of anterior CR (right). This is not surprising, given that anterior CR contributes the most to the effective power of the eye and is therefore often implicated in refractive ametropia[^1]. 

If we disregard the single outlier (right histogram; residual ~ -12D), the distribution of the residuals does resemble a normal distribution (not perfect but much better than before). These residuals can therefore be seen as **random** noise associated with **normal** variation in parameters such as the refractive indices of cornea, aqueous humour, lens and vitreous humour. They do not have as much value as AL and anterior CR in explaining the variation in SER among individuals.

This naturally leads one to wonder:
> Can we further improve the performance of a DL model that predicts ametropia from retinal images with the addition of anterior CR data?

[^1]: 2/3 of the effective power of the [Gullstrand's schematic eye](http://www.oculist.net/downaton502/prof/ebook/duanes/pages/v1/v1c033.html#mag) comes from the cornea, with the remaining coming from the lens. Recall that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?F&space;=&space;\frac{n^{'}-n}{r}&space;" title="F = \frac{n^{'}-n}{r} " />; the difference in refractive index is largest between the air (n=1) and cornea (n=1.376), making anterior CR the largest determinant of corneal effective power. Light emerging from posterior cornea experiences little change in refractive index (*cornea* n=1.376 - *aqueous* n=1.336); thus, posterior CR contributes little to corneal effective power. Likewise, there is relatively little variation in refractive index between aqueous n=1.336), lens (for the sake of simplicity, assume homogeneous lens with a constant n=1.420) and vitreous (n=1.336). Hence, variation in (anterior or posterior) lens curvature does not have as big of an impact on refractive status as anterior CR.
