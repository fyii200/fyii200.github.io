I am a PhD candidate based in the [Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences). I'm affiliated with [SCONe](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-sciences/ophthalmology/scone/about-scone) and [VAMPIRE](https://vampire.computing.dundee.ac.uk). The big picture of my PhD 
is to apply artificial intelligence approaches to predicting myopia onset, myopia progression and risk of pathologic myopia. 

> #### This site functions as an open laboratory notebook to support the [Open Science Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science). I provide a super high-level overview of my PhD below. If you have at least 20 minutes, however, you may wish to read a more elaborate version [here](https://github.com/fyii200/fyii200.github.io).

### **My research in less than 250 words**...

Machine learning (ML), much like a clinician, relies on input features (**X**), e.g. IOP, CCT, visual fields, cup-to-disc ratio, disc size, etc., to arrive at a prediction (**Y**), e.g. glaucomatous or not glaucomatous. But unlike human clinicians, ML has an enormous capacity to model complex relationships between **X** and **Y**.

Nonetheless, selecting useful **X** may not always be possible/ straightforward. Deep learning (DL), a subset of ML, addresses this challenge by obviating the need to specify **X** altogether. We can just provide raw retinal images, and it will learn to extract relevant features and model the relationship between these learned features and **Y**.

The availability of a plethora of myopia interventions with different safety profiles makes it important to stratify patients based on future progression rate. Intervention with more/ stronger side effects is justified if a patient is believed to be a fast progressor. Current prediction methods rely on population-based estimates, e.g. centile growth curve of axial length (AL), epidemiologic models (e.g. age, baseline  refractive, error, outdoor time), etc., and are therefore subject to inter-individual variability in progression rate. Prediction based on past progression rate is also [not reliable](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2769467). 

**Can we tap into the high representation power of DL to predict myopia onset and progression rate from retinal images at the *individual level*?** Such granular approach to myopia prediction will enable personalisation of interventions. Given the prospect of prophylaxis for certain cases of pathologic myopia in future, e.g. treatment targeting [CCDC102B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03649-3) for myopic maculopathy, **I'm also interested in developing image-based models to predict future risk of pathologic myopia.**

- Myopia (short-sightedness) usually happens because the eyeball is longer than normal. This   has deleterious effects on the integrity of the posterior structures of the eye. Thus, myopia predisposes individuals to sight-threatening diseases like retinal detachment (light-sensitive layer of the eye detaches from its nutrient source), myopic maculopathy (damage to the central part of the eye responsible for sharp vision). <br/> <br/>
Interventions that aim to slow myopia progression has become available in recent years. Most of them have been shown to be effective in clinical trials, but they have different safety profiles. Ideally, one wants to match stronger interventions to patients who are **likely** to experience rapid progression in future. <br/> <br/>
However, current methods of prediction are based on population-based estimates, e.g. younger sub-population with higher baseline myopia is more likely to experience fast progression. They are, therefore, subject to inter-individual variability in progression rate. Furthermore, some clinicians rely heavily on past progression rate, which is [not a reliable](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2769467) single predictive factor. <br/> <br/>
Many features of myopia are visible from retinal (back of the eye) images. The retina is also implicated as the starting point in the cascade of biochemical events that cause myopia. **Can we tap into the high represention power of deep learning to make *individualised* prediction of myopia development (if not already short-sighted) or future progression rate (already short-sighted) from retinal images?** <br/> <br/>
Given the prospect of [novel preventive treatments](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03649-3) for the development of certain myopic complications, **can we also predict the risk of future myopic complications from retinal images?** -->
